# ENGL 4\*\*\* Critical Computing in the Humanities

Spring 2016  
Prof. Dennis Tenen | dt2406 at columbia  

Our engagement with technology entails political, not just instrumental
choices. Email clients, social networks, and word processors have a profound
effect on the way we relate to each other: work, organize, relax, or make art.
Yet, we rarely have a chance to reflect on the civic, cultural virtues
implicit in numerous everyday acts of computation: connecting to a wi-fi
access point, sending a text message, or sharing a photograph online.

This course will introduce students to foundational concepts in computer
literacy. We will pry open many “black boxes”---personal computers, routers,
mobile phones---to learn not just how they work, but to interrogate them
critically. Readings in ethics, philosophy, media history, and critical theory
will ground our practical explorations.

This course advances research in computational culture studies understood both
as the study of computational culture and as computational approaches to the
study of culture and society. In addition to traditional reading, discussion,
and writing components of the class, participants are expected to work on a
semester-long data-driven lab-based research project. Students and scholars
from any field, at any stage of their academic or professional career, and at
all levels of technical and critical proficiency are welcome to attend.

## Academic Integrity

[Columbia University Undergraduate Guide to Academic
Integrity](http://www.college.columbia.edu/academics/academicintegrity)
contains the following statement:

> Academic integrity is the cornerstone of our intellectual community. All
scholarship – teaching, research, and student learning – is the product of
intellectual exchange. Whether this exchange takes place in books and journal
articles, in laboratories, in the design of experiments and the analysis of
data, in the classroom, or in students’ written work, it is these joint
undertakings that create Columbia’s intellectual community.

> The value of our collective inquiry relies upon trust and honesty – for our
individual discoveries are dependent upon the discoveries of our peers and
predecessors, here at Columbia and elsewhere. And all intellectual work must
be evaluated – the work of students is evaluated by faculty; the work of
faculty is evaluated through peer-review. We must, therefore, be able to trust
that others are honest in their work and others must be able to trust that we
are honest in ours.

> Academic writing can be very challenging, for it requires us to create
original work from our synthesis of the work done by others. In these pages
you will learn strategies for developing original work, ways to ensure that
your work is trustworthy, the consequences for submitting work that is
dishonest, and the resources available to assist you in achieving your best
work.
