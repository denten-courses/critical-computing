Every year the Digital Humanities Lab convenes to advance research in
computational culture studies understood both as the study of
*computational culture* and as *computational approaches* to the study
of culture and society. In addition to traditional reading, discussion,
and writing components of the class, participants are expected to work
on a semester-long data-driven lab-based research project. Students and
scholars from any field, at any stage of their academic or professional
career, and at all levels of technical and critical proficiency are
welcome to attend.

The course was designed with two goals in mind: first, to expand our
shared methodological toolkit (aka, learn to code),[^1] and second, to
examine the critical literature on a selected topic related to texts,
information technology, and online communities.

The theme for the spring of 2014 is illicit knowledge. In working with
several large datasets related to information piracy we will explore the
ethics of stealing and sharing, the history and the future of
censorship, the infrastructure and the social dynamics of underground
library archives, laws protecting and punishing whistleblowers, the
difference between remix and plagiarism, copyright regimes and free
culture.

**What are the Digital Humanities?**

Digital humanities are a diverse set of overlapping academic practices
which usually include some mixture of 1) computational and otherwise
experimental approaches to the study of the human condition; 2)
modalities of cultural preservation, content curation, and knowledge
design; and finally, 3) social advocacy and professional reform in
response to developments in information technology.

**Ethics Charter**

Because our research may involve sensitive materials, we will spend some
time in class drafting an ethics charter. Last year’s charter can be
found [*here*](http://piracylab.org/ethics-charter/). When working with
others, it is important to give credit where credit is due. When in
doubt, cite! Plagiarism is insulting to your peers, your instructors,
and to the research community at large. It wastes my time and yours, and
ultimately is not worth the risk. Consult Columbia’s
[*guidelines*](http://www.college.columbia.edu/academics/integrity) or
ask me for help early in the writing process.
